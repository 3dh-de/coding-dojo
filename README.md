## Process / how to run a Code Kata

### [ParisDojo](http://codingdojo.org/dojo/ParisDojo/) version

* 2 minutes: decide on date for next session
* 25-30 minutes: quick retrospective of the previous session; what went well, what was interesting, what was frustrating
* 10 minutes: decide on a topic for this session (we call these first three items the “next, prev, this” protocol)
* 40 minutes or so: code! PreparedKata or RandoriKata , see below
* 5-10 minutes: mid-session break to discuss how things are going
* 40 minutes: code some more

### DVZ M-V version (practiced with Azubis & Dualis 2018-2019)

* 5 minutes: Short Intro for Newbies (What are Code Kata? Schedule/Agenda)
* 5 minutes: decide on a topic for this session, e.g. a kata from [Clean Code Developer School](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/)
* 45 minutes or so: code! (we used Pair Programming - an experienced dev together with a newbie)
* 25 minutes: review the code of all teams (at beamer / via screen sharing) and gather lessons learned
* 5 minutes: sum up biggest learnings and set up next schedule

Of course the leader of the session code's him/herself and uses the self written code (which works flawlessly and is an perfect example of clean code) ;) as example to explain basic concepts of coding.
